<h2>Development of a Searchable Repository of Language-Based Interactions:<br>
A Tool for Research on Equity and Fairness in Linguistically Diverse Classrooms</h2>

<h3>Origin and Background</h3>
<p>Classroom conversations constitute an excellent resource for data mining and examination of the sociolinguistic aspects relevant to equity. Taking advantage of the massiveness and the openness nature of MOOCs, Understanding Language has been collecting student conversations from its online educator professional development courses, with the intent to enhance teachers’ skills to improve students’ language development and content learning, especially for English language learners. As of May, 2016, these online courses had collected transcriptions (and contextual metadata) of over 6,000 conversations from about 2,900 teachers in English Language Arts, Mathematics, Social Science/History, Science, and English Language Development/English as a Second Language, from pre-K to Grade 12.</p>

<h3>Design and Development</h3>
<p>With funding from the TELOS initiative, during the year, 2016-2017, we leveraged the technology of MOOCs and crowd sourcing, and built LogoSearch, a research-oriented, searchable repository and a platform that collects, archives, and engages with these language-based interactions from linguistically diverse classrooms across the K-12 sector. Researchers and educators are able to search and access thousands of transcriptions of students’ conversations using a variety of search criteria, filters, and facets, especially those that are relevant to equitable participation in classroom conversations. Due to its data collection and management capabilities, the repository also allows more systematic collection of MOOC data and metadata, which allows the bridging of research and professional development activities. The development of the repository began with 2,021 samples from the legacy dataset established in Fall 2013. Beyond the original goal of developing a searchable repository of student conversations, we also developed a bridging mechanism to allow integration of the platform and API functions in an LMS context. We are currently piloting the bridging mechanism and have collected 484 new structured samples, 334 of which have come with audio recordings. </p>

<h3>Challenges Addressed and Potential for Future Work</h3>
<p>We successfully addressed the challenge of creating a modern, scalable system that has important expansion possibilities. Features for future development concern expanding the repository’s capability to: 1) handle artifacts in different language modalities; 2) insert different types of annotation on data and metadata; and 3) implement appropriate standardized protocols to facilitate data exchange with other research groups or institutes.  Our dataset has currently grown to 2,173 conversations. The dataset will continue to increase with the addition of the cleaned-up legacy data as well as new data sets from our current and future courses. With the products developed, we will continue to refine the user interfaces.</p>
